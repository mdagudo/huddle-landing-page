## My process

I did the layout really quick, I just got stuck in the icons. And also I had surgery on my wisdom teeth so I paused this challenge for a few days. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm really proud of this, because I feel like I achieved the fluency of the responsive design. I feel like I have no breakpoints, I feel like my page looks good in any size and that's something I haven't done before. I also used relative units such as rem and %, and I'm happy with how it looks.

### Continued development

I really need to keep learning about Responsive Design and relative units. 

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - I used the icons from Font Awesome. 
- [Font Awesome Libraries](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) - I was so stuck with how to link my icons to my html and this page finally did it well! I tried many pages and links but it didn't work, only this one.
- [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/) - This article made me understand rem units and introduced me to the 62.5% trick!
